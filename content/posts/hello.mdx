I will write about music and coding here. I have many unordered notes about the combination of both. Many things I have already implemented, and many things I only have ideas about. This blog could be a good catalyst to transform personal chaotic notes into sharper ideas in the (pseudo) light of online exposition.

To spark your interest (am I talking to myself?), here are some things I found fascinating in the more recent past:

- music theory visualization 
  - [ ] geometry in the circle of fifth
  - [x] piano rolls
  - [x] colorization of notes / musical concepts
- music language exploration
  - [x] text & JSON formats for musical ideas
  - [ ] building a musical grammar with BNF expressions
- music in the browser
  - [x] Web Audio API
  - [x] libs like tonal & Tone.js
  - [ ] transfering established ideas like TidalCycles to the browser
- algorithmic composition
  - [ ] finding voicing through combinatorial search
  - [ ] voicing transitions
  - [ ] semi automated arranging
- parsing musical data
  - [x] hacking on ireal pro chord changes
  - [ ] insights in musical data
