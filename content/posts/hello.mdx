I will write about music and coding here. I have many unordered notes about the combination of both. Many things I have already implemented, and many things I only have ideas about. This blog could be a good catalyst to transform personal chaotic notes into sharper ideas in the (pseudo) light of online exposition.

To spark your interest (am I talking to myself?), here are some things I found fascinating in the more recent past:

- music theory visualization 
  - geometry in the circle of fifth
  - piano rolls
  - colorization of notes / musical concepts
- music language exploration
  - text & JSON formats for musical ideas
  - building a musical grammar with BNF expressions
  - self referentialism
- music in the browser
  - Web Audio API
  - libs like tonal & Tone.js
  - transfering established ideas like TidalCycles to the browser
- algorithmic composition
  - finding voicing through combinatorial search
  - voicing transitions
  - semi automated arranging
- parsing musical data
  - hacking on ireal pro chord changes
  - insights in musical data
  - building
