To build a hackable backing track player, we now got rhythm and harmony. What's missing: Melodies.
Even if we just want a backing track player, playing melodies is required for basslines, or any kind of melodic fill in.

So far, we were generating voicings from chord symbols. The problem: melodies will eventually use notes that are not a chord notes.
Therefore, we need a way to find scales that fit to chord changes.
