As this is the third part of the Just Intonation series, let's talk about thirds.

## 5 Limit Tuning

With 5 limit tuning, we can use powers of 5 as an addition to the powers of 3 to generate ratios.
This means that for each number of fifths, we can add any number of thirds. As a formula, this means:

<InlineMath>{"R_{5} = 2^{a} * 3^{b} * 5^{c}"}</InlineMath>

Like in the last post, we will use octave reduction to automatically set the exponent of 2 to keep the end result between 1 and 2.
Having that out of the way we now have two exponents left that can have arbitrary values.

So 5 limit tuning brings a whole new dimension to our system: The first dimension is the 3 (fifths) and the second, new dimension is the 5 (thirds).

### Name collisions

It may sound wrong that the 3 stands for a fifth, while the 5 stands for a third, but this just stems from the naming convention of musical intervals,
based on 7 notes per octave. Funny enough, the next prime numbers are 7, which adds the minor seventh, and 9, which adds the major second (or 9th).
But let's stay with 3 and 5 for now.

### Lattice

Having the 2 dimensions of 3 and 5, we can visualize their powers in a lattice, which is a common way of display:
