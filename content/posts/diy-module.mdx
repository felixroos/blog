Let's talk about building synth modules..
I am still a noob in the area of eurorack and modular synthesis, but I try to learn how to build
modules, as I want to sharpen my electronics skills and save some money.

This "module" is my first attempt at finding out how to create a module from scratch.
At the end of this post, this will not be a finished, usable product, but merely walk
with tiny baby steps into the direction of DIY module building.

Here you see the finished control module. From bottom to top, you can see:

- Potentiometers knobs
- Wood Panel
- Potentiometers
- PCB for Potentiometers
- Hex Connectors
- PCB for module (not there yet)

As you might notice, this module only contains potentiometers and no jacks + no actual module electronics or power supply.
I will add this stuff later, this will only be a study in the frontend of things..

## BOM

Here is a list of parts I used:

- 4 [100k Alpha Potentiometers](https://syntaxis.com.pl/en/potentiometers/91-potentiometer-b100k.html) á 1,94€ = 7,76€
- 4 [Knobs with washers](https://syntaxis.com.pl/en/knobs/101-knob-k88-gry.html) á 0,38€ = 1,52€
- 4 [Knob Caps](https://syntaxis.com.pl/en/knobs/102-cap-k85-red.html) á 0,32€ = 1,28€
- scrap wood panel piece for a few cents
- 1 [50x100mm stripboard](https://www.amazon.de/Rademacher-Streifenrasterplatine-Hartpapier-Rasterma%C3%9F-Leiterbahnen/dp/B085WJ7535/) á 0,84€
- 2 [Brass Standoff Spacers + screws](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07RP6CRD5) ~0,20€
- [JST-XH plug and socket](https://www.amazon.de/YIXISI-Stecker-Weiblich-Adapter-M%C3%A4nnlich/dp/B082ZLYRRN/) á ~0,20€
  - you also need a [crimping tool](https://www.amazon.de/Crimpzange-Dupont-Stecker-Steckverbinder-Crimpkontakten/dp/B07QX51F3B/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=JST-XH&qid=1615388011&s=diy&sr=1-4)
- [wire](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07V3C686H/) (could also use strand)

All in all, the price for those components is at about 12€.

## Cuttin the Wood Panel

![panel cut](./img/diy-module/IMG_0649.jpeg)

From a larger wood piece, I cut a row of 3U (133.4mm). Then I mark where the rails are, so nothing will be in the way later.
Then I can cut smaller pieces if I want to build a module. The piece on the right is approximately 6HP which is ~30mm.

## Drilling Holes

To get the holes in the right spot, I stick the pots into a pcb at a desirable distance and lay them to the wood piece:

![pot drilling](./img/diy-module/IMG_0661.jpeg)

I also drew a (pretty inaccurate) centerline to help me drill.

## Preparing Pots

Now the pots must be prepared. First, I remove the little metal knubsi:

![metal knubsi](./img/diy-module/IMG_0666.jpeg)

Then, I straighten the side pins:

![metal knubsi](./img/diy-module/IMG_0667.jpeg)

On the right, you can see how it should look like.

## Preparing the first PCB

Now, after screwing the pots to the panel, we can gently push the pcb ontop:

![pcb test](./img/diy-module/IMG_0669.jpeg)

Here, I aligned one end of the pcb the end of the wood panel. To align the other side, I mark it:

![marked pcb](./img/diy-module/IMG_0671.jpeg)

... cut it

![cut pcb](./img/diy-module/IMG_0672.jpeg)

... and break it on a table end

![broken pcb](./img/diy-module/IMG_0673.jpeg)

After some sanding, the pcb should fit the panel:

## Preparing the second PCB

As I am using single sided stripboard, I need a second pcb to have more space for components later.
If I were using double sided pcb, I could just connect another pcb using male pins and female sockets.
But because single sided stripboard is much much cheaper, and [available in 5cmx10cm](https://www.amazon.de/Rademacher-Streifenrasterplatine-Hartpapier-Rasterma%C3%9F-Leiterbahnen/dp/B085WJ7535/), I will just use a second layer and connect it hex screws.
For this module, I needed only one pcb for both layers, which costs around 84 cents.

To know where to screw without screwing up, I marked where the component footprints are on the other pcb:

![component footprint](./img/diy-module/IMG_0683.jpeg)

After screwing 2 holes in each board, they can be screwed together using hex spaces + M3 screws:

![spacers](./img/diy-module/IMG_0685.jpeg)

## Preparing the connector

To connect the boards, I will manually crimp a JST-XH plug with 6 wires (+, - and 4 pot values). I will need these parts:

![connector parts](./img/diy-module/IMG_0690.jpeg)

... after crimping the cable ends

![spacers](./img/diy-module/IMG_0691.jpeg)

Now the crimped contacts can be plugged into the plug:

![plug](./img/diy-module/IMG_0692.jpeg)

## Soldering

After the preparation, the pots can be soldered onto the first board:

![soldered pots](./img/diy-module/IMG_0694.jpeg)

Then, the one side of the pot pins must be connected to voltage (red) and the other to ground (black).
After connecting all pins on the first board, we can connect the plug wires.
The middle pot pins can be soldered directly to the plug (yellow wires).
The last step is to solder on the jack on the second board and connect it:

![soldered plug](./img/diy-module/IMG_0695.jpeg)

## Done?

So far, the controls are connected and can be easily accessed on the second board.
Now we can screw it on rails:

![in case](./img/diy-module/IMG_0699.jpeg)

## Future goal: Making it functional

This could be made into a finished ADSR module by adding the [uADSR-3310-A](https://syntaxis.com.pl/en/micromodules/80-uadsr-3310-a.html) (20,24€).
So a finished module could be made for ~35€.

To add the uModule, I need to add a [female socket](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07Q1XBGFB/) for the module.
To power the module, I can either connect eurorack power plugs using [male pins](https://youtu.be/tok3l28D55k?t=677) or using a [standard box header](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Wurth-Elektronik/61201021621?qs=%2Fha2pyFadujEIp2%2FjsKWLXg%252Bb4e8v61jj1J6zp6AkGGUW5Lrb6Z%2Fiw==&utm_source=octopart&utm_medium=aggregator&utm_campaign=710-61201021621&utm_content=Wurth+Elektronik).

The module can either be patched at the backend using more female sockets and dupont cables or by cramping some [3.5mm jack sockets](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/thonkiconn/) in as well.
For this build, I will go with dupont cables in the back, but in the future, I want to build modules with eurorack compatible jacks as well.
Having 4 pots and 2 jacks (input + output) in 6U might be a little bit fiddly though..
