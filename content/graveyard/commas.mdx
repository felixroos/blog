## Pythagorean Comma

To correct the pythagorean comma, we could subtract (=divide) a n/12 of the comma from every nth fifth:

<BlockMath>{`R_n = \\frac{3^{b}}{R_{pc}*\\frac{b}{12}} = \\frac{12*3^{b}}{R_{pc}*b}`}</BlockMath>

If we now calculate the 13th fifth with that formula:

<BlockMath>{`R_{13} = \\frac{3^{12}}{R_{pc}*\\frac{12}{12}} = \\frac{3^{12}}{R_{pc}} = \\frac{3^{12}}{{((\\frac{3}{2})}^{12} : 2^7)} = 2^{19}`}</BlockMath>

Now we have established octave stability, but we sacrificed the pure intervals for it...
