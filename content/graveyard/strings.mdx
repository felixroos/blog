## Theory of Strings

Lets take this string:

<FrequencyPlot
  height={150}
  frequencies={[[1, 1, 0]]}
  addSum={false}
  colors={["green"]}
  autostartAnimation={true}
  animationSpeed={1 / 500}
/>

Physically spoken, this is the point of maximal **potential energy**, and no **kinetic energy**.
It will now start accelerating down, reaching full kinetic energy here:

<FrequencyPlot
  height={50}
  frequencies={[[1, 0, 0]]}
  addSum={false}
  colors={["green"]}
/>

After this point, the kinetic energy will decrease again, and the potential energy will rise until the other end:

<FrequencyPlot
  height={150}
  frequencies={[[1, -1, 0]]}
  addSum={false}
  colors={["green"]}
/>

From there, the whole process will happen again in the other direction.

- One full cycle of string vibration is completed when the initial position (directly after plucking) is reached again.
- The sound is produced as the string pushes the air molecules around it

For the string, the basic units are:

- frequency = number of vibrations per second
- wavelength = 2\*length of string
- amplitude = distance from the initial pluck position to the rest position

### Example

Lets say this is the string elongation (y axis) over the time period of 100 seconds (x axis):

<FrequencyPlot
  height={150}
  hideAxes={false}
  frequencies={[
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0.5, 0],
    [1, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 0],
  ]}
  colors={Array(10)
    .fill()
    .map((_, i) => interpolateRainbow(i / 10))}
  addSum={false}
/>

- green: 50Hz with amplitude of 100%
- red: 50Hz with amplitude of 50%
- blue: amplitude of 0% => frequency could be anything
- yellow: 100Hz with amplitude of 100%

## Reality of Strings

In reality, this pushing of air + dampening of the string leads to energy "loss", which will decrease the amplitude over time, eventually bringing it to rest.

Also, the string will not vibrate with a single frequency, but with multiple ones that are superimposed.
It depends on the material which frequencies are heard, but there is also a simple principle that is shared by not only strings, but all physical objects that vibrate:
