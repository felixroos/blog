Now we have a bunch of fractions.. how can we calculate the absolute timing information with them?

## Calculating Absolute Time

If we now know the total length of the piece, we can multiply it with the relative fraction to get the absolute time and duration.

## About Note Values

Let's talk about [Note Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_value).
In our example, we use different fractions to express note values. But what do the fractions refer to?

Generally, the note value tells the relation of the notes value to the duration of one bar (in 4/4).

### Calculating Absolute Durations

If we want to calculate the absolute duration of a note value, we need to know how long one beat is.
If we take a tempo of 60bpm, we have:

<BlockMath>{`60 bpm = 60 b/m = 60b/60s = 1b/s`}</BlockMath>

Most of the time, the term beat means one quarter note. With that we can calculate the duration of each note value:

<BlockMath>{`1/4 = 1s, 1/8 = 0.5s, 1/24 = 0.16s`}</BlockMath>

### Calculating Absolute Time

If we also knew when each note is played, we have all the information to represent the rhythm as absolute timed events.
As we already know the durations, this is quite easy. We just have to sum all durations that came before.
In the bolero example, the second 16th triplet in bar 2 begins at:

<BlockMath>{`3/4 + 1/8 + 1/24 = 0.916s`}</BlockMath>

<!-- TBD: make Tree clickable to calculate the selected node's time -->

For each node, we multiply its path fraction (before the bracket) with each parent's relative subdivisions
(inside the brackets). The products are then summed up.
You can read it the same way your eyes would move along the tree line (oscillating down and up).
