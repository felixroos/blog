### Why fifths?

The lesser fifths it takes to get from one pitch to another, the more consonant they sound together.
The reason lies in the overtone series, as the fifth is the first interval that is not an octave, which leads to more common overtones than any other interval.

<PitchSpectrum frequencies={Array.from({ length: 16 }, (_, i) => 440 * (i + 1))} min={440} max={440 * 16} />
<br />
<PitchSpectrum frequencies={Array.from({ length: 16 }, (_, i) => 660 * (i + 1))} min={440} max={440 * 16} />
<br />
<PitchSpectrum frequencies={Array.from({ length: 16 }, (_, i) => 990 * (i + 1))} min={440} max={440 * 16} />

The three strips above represent the first 16 overtones of A (440Hz - 7040Hz) compared to the overtones of E (660Hz) and B (990Hz) in that range.
Using this visualization, we can see which overtones line up and which don't.
E has 5/16 common tones with A, while B only has 1. This shows that the common overtones decrease as we move away in fifths.
