Let's talk about chords and scales, which are the basis of any musical endeavour. Having the SVG Piano from last post, we can visualize them properly.

## Primer: Music terminology

You may or may not have a music background, so here are the concepts you need to know:

### Pitch

Pitch is the percepted "height" of a sound.

- If a sound has no pitch, we can call it noise. When talking about musical harmony, pitches are more interesting than noise. Noise is more related to rhythm and feel.
- If a sound has a pitch, it has a perceptible frequency
- [As Sound is essentially the vibration of air molecules](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/sound.html), the frequency describes how many times per second the sound is oscillating
- Higher frequency means higher pitch, lower frequency means lower pitch.

### Notes and Tuning Systems

- Notes are just names we gave certain pitches.
- Depending on culture, the pitches that are chosen may vary. A certain "mapping" of note name to pitch is called tuning system.
- No matter which tuning system we take, the mapping is always in some way connected to physical phenomenon of the overtone series.
- At this point we are going to use the western equal temperament, as it is widely used and most flexible.

### Western note system

- There are 12 notes in one octave, if you wonder why, watch [why there are 12 notes in music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9CPoe5LnM)
- In equal temperament those 12 notes all have the same distance
- The letters from A to G describe 7 of the 12 notes
- The other 5 notes can be derived from the 7 letters by sharpening or flattening
  - Sharpening: append "#" to the letter. e.g. F# which is spoken "F sharp"
  - Flattening: append "b" to the letter. e.g. Bb which is spoken "B flat"
- At the piano keyboard you see a repeating pattern of 7 white keys with 5 black keys in it
  - The 7 white keys are labeled with the letters A to G
  - Each of the 5 black keys is named relative to one of its white neighbour keys
  - for example, the black key right to the white key "F" would be called "F#"
  - the same key can also be seen as being left to the key "G", so we can also call it "Gb"
  - This way, each black key can have two different names, one with a "#" and the other with a "b"

### Why seven and five?

Good question. There is no clear reason except history, but here is an observation:

> 5 and 7 are the only numbers 12 that do not divide 12 into non homegenous parts:

### Keyboard design

Just imagine we want to design a keyboard layout for the piano, without knowing anything about its current design.

Those are the design requirements:

1. There are 12 different notes
2. The 12 keys repeat to up to 88 keys to fill the human hearing range
3. Our eyes & fingers should be able to find key locations quickly

Design insight #1:

> If we would make all the keys look the same, we would have no clue which is which.

_What if we label the keys with letters ABCDEFGHIJKL?_

This would, to some extent, work for our eyes, but our fingers alone would be clueless

Design insight #2:

> We need at least two different types of keys, to give haptic information

So we can comprehend the decision to use white and black keys

- they have different colors (eyes)
- and different positions/forms (fingers)

Having two types of keys, we have to decide how many of each we will use:

_What about 6 white and 6 black keys?_

Schematically, this would look something like this:

> X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X

or this

> XX--XX--XX--

or this

> XXX---XXX---

or this

> XXXXXX------

or this

> XXXX--XX----

...or any other permutation of 6 inside 12.

("X" is one type of key, and "-" the other type)

If we think through the above proposals, none of them, except maybe the last one meet our requirements.

Design insight #3:

> Regular patterns create ambiguity

This means, that for example in the first proposal, there are no quickly recognizable properties of a certain key:

```txt
X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-
          ^ this is the 6th X key from the left
```

```txt
X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-
                                ^ this is the 5th X key from the right
```

As you see, we can not recognize a key without counting.
If we want a keyboard that fills the human hearing range, we need about 80 keys.
This would make 40 white and 40 black keys. Counting from left or right, to identify a key in the middle, we have to count at max to 20!

Without going into detail, thinking through the other proposals, yields a similar result:
We always have to count our way to the middle if we want to recognize a key.

Design insight #4:

> Irregular patterns create recognizable anchors

The last pattern is the only one thats irregular. Lets extend it to more keys:

```txt
XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----
             ^ this is the 2nd key of the 4 Xes
```

```txt
XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----
                              ^ this is first key of the 2 Xes
```

```txt
XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----XXXX--XX----
                     ^ this is second key after the 2 Xes
```

This is great! We no longer have to count to the middle to find identify one of the 12 keys.
All we have to do is looking at a smaller region of keys to find out its relation to the others.

_Can we do better?_

In the 4 vs 2 design, we have to count up to 4, or to two if we use the from the right/left shortcut.
Maybe there are patterns that are better in terms of max count size & simplicity.

> Design insight #5: If irregularity is the key, maybe we should use numbers that do NOT divide 12

So which numbers do not divide 12? AHA: 5 and 7:

> X-X-X--X-X--

1.  X-----------
2.  X-----X-----
3.  X---X---X---
4.  X--X--X--X--
5.  X-X-X--X-X--
6.  X-X-X-X-X-X-
7.  ?
8.  -XX-XX-XX-XX
9.  -XXX-XXX-XXX
10. -XXXXX-XXXXX
11. -XXXXXXXXXXX
12. XXXXXXXXXXXX

### Why 7 and 5 ?

You may ask why just name 7 of 12

## Intervals

- An Interval is the distance between two notes

Before we talk about chords & scales, we have to look at intervals first. The term interval referns to the distance of two notes
