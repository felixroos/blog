- [river problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem)
- generate and test (tree book)
- Rumpelstiltskin principle: magic of the right word
- simple ideas are often the most powerful. dont say trivial
- intelligence is not just about reasoning. 
  - problem solving works all across our senses
  - example: How many countries does the equator cross in africa, without and with world image
- history of ai:
  - ada lovelace & alan turing
  - age of speculation
  - dawn age

## 2. Reasoning: Goal Trees and Problem Solving

this talk is about a program that could solve integration problems.
It aids as a one lectoure introduction to ai, using a famous example.

<BlockMath>{`\\frac{3}{4}`}</BlockMath>

- problem reduction: converting complex problem in more simple one
  - "safe transforms": always work to make it simpler
    - e.g. pull out constants
    - e.g. pull out sum => creates sub problem for each summand
  - heuristic transformation: sometimes work
    - e.g. trig transformation (from one trigononmetric form to another)
    - e.g. family of trig to polynomial transformations
    - e.g. family polynomial to trig transformations
  - problem reduction tree / and or tree / goal tree
    - and = sums
    - or = different possible solutions 
- knowledge >about knowledge< is power
- catechism
