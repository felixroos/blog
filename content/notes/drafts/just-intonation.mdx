### n-Limit

As we saw with the example of the stacked fifths, ratios can still sound good together even if their numerators/denominators are relatively high.
The mere fact that the ratios are related by being powers of the same simple ratio makes them stick together.

This insight leads to another way of organizing ratios: n-Limit tuning.
It allows us to generate families of ratios by multiplying natural numbers up to n, with any combination of real number exponents.

<p>
  For example, the formula for generating 3 limit tuning ratios is <InlineMath>{`R_3 = 2^a * 3^b`}</InlineMath>
</p>

Note that the number 1 can be ignored, as it does not change anything. We could generate the frequency ratios for 4 stacked fifths with:

<InlineMath>{`R = 2^{0} * 3^0 = 1`}</InlineMath>
<br />
<InlineMath>{`R = 2^{-1} * 3^1 = \\frac{3}{2}`}</InlineMath>
<br />
<InlineMath>{`R = 2^{-3} * 3^2 = \\frac{9}{8}`}</InlineMath>
<br />
<InlineMath>{`R = 2^{-4} * 3^3 = \\frac{27}{16}`}</InlineMath>
<br />
<InlineMath>{`R = 2^{-6} * 3^4 = \\frac{81}{64}`}</InlineMath>

While the exponent of the 3 counts up, the exponent of the 2 just cares for octave reduction (keeping the result between 1 and 2).

The next logical limit would be 5-limit tuning, as the number 4 can already be expressed as 2\*2.
Generally, non-prime numbers are not interesting, as they can be factorized with lower prime numbers.

### Lattices

n-Limit ratios can be visualized using multidimensional lattices.

#### 3-limit

TBD

If we are only interested in octave reduced ratios, we can ignore one dimension, enabling us to express 3-limit tuning in only one dimension:

TBD

#### 5-limit

Octave reduced 5-limit tuning can be visualized in two dimensions:
