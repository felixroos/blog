## tracks reducer

be able to transform one event array multiple times for different purposes:

- chords 
- basslines
- "meta" events like boxes or detected seven note scales

## editor

- textarea under player, updates on key shortcut or button click

## add group boxes

- like in rhythmical REPL
- add an event for each group (ignore in playback, just for viz)
- each group event is also visualized as a box

## advanced colorization

colorize by.. 

- nesting deepness
- pitch
- degree in current scale / chord
- related chroma(s) (or related 7 note scales)

## midi importer

- be able to transform midi data to rhythmical events
- maybe add a feature that allows setting a time value and not use nesting:

```js
{
  duration: 4,
  midi: [ // [time, value, duration]
    [0, 'D4', 1],
    [0, 'F4', 1],
    [0, 'A4', 1],
    [1, 'G4', 1],
    [1, 'B4', 1],
    [1, 'D4', 1],
    [2, 'C4', 2],
    [2, 'E4', 2],
    [2, 'G4', 2],
  ];
}
```

=> this allows importing any premade midi melody from notation programs etc..
=> just insert midi + add chords => done song..

## ties

```js
renderRhythmObject({
  duration: 4,
  value: [
    ['C', 'E'],
    ['_', 'D']
  ]
});
// renders to
[
  { value: 'C', duration: 1 },
  { value: 'E', duration: 2 },
  { value: 'D', duration: 1 }
];
```

## velocity

- multiply down
- already added to sampler => add to all other instruments

## chords

- resolve chord symbols to polyphonic notes

## nudge

- allows microadjustment of notes
- time and duration of siblings might be affected too

## swing

- nudges every second attack, inside a specified grid size

## string notation

like tidal

## event buffer

- instead of rendering a whole piece, just repeat a short time loop e.g. 1 second
- prerender only the events for the next cycle
- allows creating endlessly alternating loops
- similar to how tidal does it
- needs some way of handling render state
- could use a generator function
- more dynamic & manipulation friendly system

## polymeter

the event buffer would be good to render polymeters in a performant way

```js
{
  polymeter: [
    ['C', 'D'],
    ['E', 'F', 'G']
  ];
}
```

behaves like

```js
[
  { polyphonic: ['C', 'E'] },
  { polyphonic: ['D', 'F'] }, // first loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['C', 'G'] }, // second loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['D', 'E'] }, // first loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['C', 'F'] },
  { polyphonic: ['D', 'G'] } // first + second loop finished
];
```

- a polymeter different pulse lengths (2 & 3 above) will repeat with a cycle length of their least common multiple (6 above)

try to use https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs with tonejs! (and use as plugin for rhythmical later)
