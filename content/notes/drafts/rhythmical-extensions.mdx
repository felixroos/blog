## ties

```js
renderRhythmObject({
  duration: 4,
  value: [
    ['C', 'E'],
    ['_', 'D']
  ]
});
// renders to
[
  { value: 'C', duration: 1 },
  { value: 'E', duration: 2 },
  { value: 'D', duration: 1 }
];
```

## velocity

- multiply down

## chords

- resolve chord symbols to polyphonic notes

## nudge

- allows microadjustment of notes
- time and duration of siblings might be affected too

## swing

- nudges every second attack, inside a specified grid size

## string notation

like tidal

## event buffer

- instead of rendering a whole piece, just repeat a short time loop e.g. 1 second
- prerender only the events for the next cycle
- allows creating endlessly alternating loops
- similar to how tidal does it
- needs some way of handling render state
- could use a generator function
- more dynamic & manipulation friendly system

## polymeter

the event buffer would be good to render polymeters in a performant way

```js
{
  polymeter: [
    ['C', 'D'],
    ['E', 'F', 'G']
  ];
}
```

behaves like

```js
[
  { polyphonic: ['C','E'] },
  { polyphonic: ['D','F'] }, // first loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['C','G'] }, // second loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['D','E'] }, // first loop finished
  { polyphonic: ['C','F'] },
  { polyphonic: ['D','G'] }, // first + second loop finished
]
```

- a polymeter different pulse lengths (2 & 3 above) will repeat with a cycle length of their least common multiple (6 above)

try to use https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs with tonejs! (and use as plugin for rhythmical later)
