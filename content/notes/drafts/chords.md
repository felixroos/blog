Let's talk about intervals and chords + their representations. Let's start with the basics:

## What's an interval?

An interval is distance between two notes, either expressed in semitones or with its musical term.
Those are the basic intervals:

| semitones | musical name                                 | short    | degree      | in C     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 0         | prime/unison                                 | 1P       | 1           | C        |
| 1         | semitone: minor second, augmented prime      | 2m, 1A   | b2/b9, #1   | Db, C#   |
| 2         | whole tone: major second, (diminished third) | 2M, (3d) | 2, (bb3)    | D, (Ebb) |
| 3         | minor third, augmented second                | 3m, 2A   | b3, (#2)/#9 | Eb, D#   |
| 4         | major third, (dimished fourth)               | 3M, (4d) | 3, (b4)     | E, (Fb)  |
| 5         | perfect fourth, (augmented third)            | 4P, (3A) | 4, (#3)     | F, (E#)  |
| 6         | tritone: augmented fourth, dimished fifth    | 4A, 5d   | #4/#11, b5  | F#, Gb   |
| 7         | perfect fifth, (diminished sixth)            | 5P, (6d) | 5, (bb6)    | G, Abb   |
| 8         | minor sixth, augmented fifth                 | 6m, 5A   | b6, #5      | Ab, G#   |
| 9         | major sixth, diminished seventh              | 6M, 7d   | 6/13, bb7   | A, Bbb   |
| 10        | minor seventh, (augmented sixth)             | 7m, (6A) | b7, #6      | Bb, A#   |
| 11        | major seventh                                | 7M       | 7           | B        |

- An interval consists of a number and a quality
- there are seven different numbers: prime (1), second (2), third (3), fourth (4), fifths (5), sixths (6), seventh (7)
- ... and 5 different qualities: perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (A) and dimished (d)
- the minor quality is always one semitone lower than its major quality
- the augmented quality is one semitone higher than its major quality
- the dimished quality is one semitone lower than its minor quality

In practice, some combinations of number and quality are never used:

- primes are always perfect
- fifths and fourths are either perfect, augmented or dimished
- seconds cannot be dimished
- the others (thirds, sixths and sevenths) are either major, minor, augmented or diminished

Degrees are a common way to talk about steps in a scale or chord. They are simplification of the interval short notation. One or more preceeding flats (b) or sharps (#) are used instead of succeeding qualities:

- using no modifier implies the major quality (M)
- using a flat (b) implies the minor quality (m)
- using two flats (bb) implies the diminished quality (d)
- using a sharp (#) implies the augmented quality (A)

### Why is this naming system so irregular?

I won't answer this question deeply here, but essentially, western music culture (among others) is based the 7 note scale, inside the 12 pitch system, which is based on the harmonic series. I will write about this in a future post.

### Building intervals from any note

If you want to build an interval from any given note, like the diminished fifth of F#, you can:

1. start from the natural note, which is the note without accidentals (= F)
2. build the interval in its major quality, which is perfect or major (F + 5P = C)
3. add the accidental of the starting note (C + # = C#)
4. add the accidental of the interval quality (C# + b = C#b = C)

## What's a chord?

Simply put, a chord is a minimum of three notes played at the same time.
Depending on the intervals that form between the notes, the chord has a specific character.

### 3 note chords aka triads

The most basic chord is the triad, which consists of three notes, forming two intervals between. There are four basic triads:

| musical name     | short  | intervals | steps   | in C    |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| major triad      | M, ""  | 3M 3m     | 1 3 5   | C E G   |
| minor triad      | m, -   | 3m 3M     | 1 b3 5  | C Eb G  |
| diminished triad | o, d   | 3m 3m     | 1 b3 b5 | C Eb Gb |
| augmented triad  | +, aug | 3M 3M     | 1 3 #5  | C E G#  |

Those are the basic triads, which are essentially a permutation of two stacked minor or major thirds.
