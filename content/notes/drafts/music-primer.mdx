Let's talk about chords and scales, which are the basis of any musical endeavour. Having the SVG Piano from last post, we can visualize them properly.

## Primer: Music terminology

You may or may not have a music background, so here are the concepts you need to know:

### Pitch

Pitch is the percepted "height" of a sound.

- If a sound has no pitch, we can call it noise. When talking about musical harmony, pitches are more interesting than noise. Noise is more related to rhythm and feel.
- If a sound has a pitch, it has a perceptible frequency
- [As Sound is essentially the vibration of air molecules](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/sound.html), the frequency describes how many times per second the sound is oscillating
- Higher frequency means higher pitch, lower frequency means lower pitch.

### Notes and Tuning Systems

- Notes are just names we gave certain pitches.
- Depending on culture, the pitches that are chosen may vary. A certain "mapping" of note name to pitch is called tuning system.
- No matter which tuning system we take, the mapping is always in some way connected to physical phenomenon of the overtone series.
- At this point we are going to use the western equal temperament, as it is widely used and most flexible.

### Western note system

- There are 12 notes in one octave, if you wonder why, watch [why there are 12 notes in music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9CPoe5LnM)
- In equal temperament those 12 notes all have the same distance
- The letters from A to G describe 7 of the 12 notes
- The other 5 notes can be derived from the 7 letters by sharpening or flattening
  - Sharpening: append "#" to the letter. e.g. F# which is spoken "F sharp"
  - Flattening: append "b" to the letter. e.g. Bb which is spoken "B flat"
- At the piano keyboard you see a repeating pattern of 7 white keys with 5 black keys in it
  - The 7 white keys are labeled with the letters A to G
  - Each of the 5 black keys is named relative to one of its white neighbour keys
  - for example, the black key right to the white key "F" would be called "F#"
  - the same key can also be seen as being left to the key "G", so we can also call it "Gb"
  - This way, each black key can have two different names, one with a "#" and the other with a "b"

### Why seven and five?

Good question. There is no clear reason except history, but here is an observation:

> 5 and 7 are the only numbers 12 that do not divide 12 into non homegenous parts:

### Why 7 and 5 ?

You may ask why just name 7 of 12

## Intervals

- An Interval is the distance between two notes

Before we talk about chords & scales, we have to look at intervals first. The term interval referns to the distance of two notes
