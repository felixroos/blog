Pythagoras

582-500 BC

Discovered the relationship between harmony and numbers.
More famous for his geometry equation for right-angled triangles, Pythagoras has also been credited with discovering the relationship between harmony and numbers.

Using a monochord, which has one string and a moveable bridge, he could produce two different tones at the same time by plucking the string on either side of the bridge. Marking the position of the bridge gave him the measurements to support his discoveries that:

A musical octave occurs when the length of one string is exactly twice or one-half the length of the other string. The ratio is 2:1 or 1:2, and the fractions are 2/1 and 1/2. (An octave is the same note at a higher or lower pitch. A scale is made up of the notes between two octaves. It is called an octave because it is the eighth note in a seven-note scale.)
The most pleasing harmony occurs when the length of the second string is 3/2 or 3/4 that of the first string. We call this note a fifth because it is the fifth note of the modern western scale.
The next most harmonious notes occur with the second string being 4/3 or 2/3 of the first string. This is now known as the fourth note in our modern western scale.
Pythagoras built a seven-note harmonic musical scale using only three ratios:

1/2 for an octave
3/2 for a perfect fifth
4/3 for a perfect fourth
For example, he created the "second", a 9/8 ratio, by increasing a fifth (3/2) by another fifth (3/2), and then, to keep it in the same octave, he applied the octave 1/2 rule. The result was 3/2 x 3/2 x 1/2 = 9/8.

In order of the familiar scale, do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, here are the calculations for his scale:

1 do - 1/1 - key or tonic = 1.000
2 re - 3/2 x 3/2 = 9/4 x 1/2 = 9/8 = 1.1250
3 me - 9/8 x 9/8 = 81/64 = 1.26525
4 fa - 4/3 - as discovered = 1.3333
5 so - 3/2 - as discovered = 1.5000
6 la - 9/8 x 3/2 = 27/16 = 1.6875
7 ti - 3/2 x 9/8 x 9/8 = 243/128 = 1.8984375
8 do - 2/1 - the octave = 2.0000
Great metaphysical significance was given by him to the fact that all harmonies came from the numbers one, two, three and four.

When tones of a pure harmonuc scale are sounded simultaneously, another harmonic tone is created that Helmholtz called a combinational tone. Denny Doherty of the Mamas and Papas called it the "fifth voice".

However, because the tuning is based on ratios of the first note, changing the key or root in a song means changing the tuning of any fixed-tone instrument, such as a piano or guitar.

A more basic problem, called the Pythagorean comma is described as follows:

After cycling through the fifth note of a scale twelve times, we should arrive back at the first note seven octaves higher. However, 3/2 multiplied by itself 12 times is higher than 2 multiplied by itself 7 times. The difference is about one-quarter of a semitone per octave.
Over the centuries, musicians have dealt with this problem in various ways using meantone temperament, well temperament, equal temperament and now by usings a just intonation tuning cube that tunes electronic musical instruments as they are being played.


Marin Mersenne


(1588 to 1648)


Contributed to understanding the physics of music.
Marin Mersenne, a French theologian, philosopher, mathematician, and music thoerist, is mostly remembered for his work with prime numbers, while also being the central exchange for scientific information between mathematicians and scientists, including Galileo, Kepler and Descartes.

He contriubuted greatly to our understanding of the physics of music, musical instruments and acoustics through his well-documented experiments.

The credit for the first correct published account of the vibration of strings is usually given to Marin Mersenne. He studied the vibrations of musical tones by using brass-ball weights attached to brass wires, adjusting the tension with the amount of weight.

In 1636, he published the following laws in his Harmonie universelle. the theory and practice of music including the nature of sound, movement, key, voice, mood and harmonic instruments.
.

When the tension on a string remains the same, but the length L is varied, the period of the vibration or frequency F is proportional to L. This is also known as Pythagorasâ€™ Law.
When the length of a string is held constant but the tension T is varied, the frequency of the oscillation F is proportional to the square root of T.
For different strings of the same length and tension, the period is inversely proportional to the square root of W, where W is the weight of the string.
 

Some of Mersenne's books were published in Latin. The following is a translation of the title page to
HARMONICORUM LIBRI XII, published in 1648:

'"Twelve books of harmonic principles in which the nature of sounds is treated, in their causes and affects: about harmonies, dissonance, ratios, types, modes, songs, composition and the harmonic instruments of all the world."
.

Although Marin Mersenne produced a correct and systematic description of equal temperament in 1635, it was not adopted until nearly 100 years later in Germany.

 

Johann Sebastian Bach


(1685 - 1750)

Preferred well temperament over equal temperament.
By the beginning of the 18th century, musicians everywhere were using a variety of tuning systems and keyboards.

In fixed tone instruments, the Pythagorean comma, one-quarter of a semitione, was distributed amongst the 12 semitones of each octave in different ways:

Meantone temperament allowed modulation into certain keys, which worked as long as certain "wolf" tones were avoided. They were called wolf tones because they sounded like howling wolves.
Well temperament allowed for full modulation and eliminated wolf tones at the price of sacrificing a little pure harmony here and there. Since the intervals between the pure semitones still varied in size, when a scale began on a different note or key, its tuning characteristics were unique.
Equal temperament, where each of the 12 notes are evenly distributed within the octave by, starting at one, multiplying the frequency of the previous note by 1.059463094 until two is reached. Pure harmony is sacrificed for the convenience of not having to retune when there is a change of key.
J. S. Bach clearly demonstrated his tuning preference. The Well Tempered Clavier* is the title he gave to the study books he released in 1722 and 1744, each consisting of 24 preludes and 24 fugues composed in each of the 12 major and 12 minor keys. Composed "for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning, and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study", it is obvious that Bach's main purpose was to demonstrate the feasibility of a tuning system that would allow for composition in every key.
Many manuscript copies were made by his pupils and copies spread steadily over Europe with his fame. Both books were published in 1801. Equal temperament had been introduced in Germany about 100 years earlier.

Bach made a diagram at the top of the title page of the Well Tempered Clavier visually describing how the clavier should be tuned for the the well tempered tuning required. When the diagram is turned upside down, the loops represent the distribution of the Pythagorean comma between the 12 fifths of the octaves, in the order of the cycle of fifths, starting with the F - C interval on the left.



The first five large loops (C, G, D, A, E) enclose three smaller loops indicating that for these five intervals, a perfect fifth should be flattened by a factor of 3.
The next three&nbsp;large loops without inner loops (B, F#, C#) indicate three pure intervals of a fifth, without any beats, perfectly in tune.
The three large loops at the right (G#, D#, A#) indicate three intervals enclosing one smaller loop indicating that these fifths should only be flattened by a factor of 1.
Dividing the Pythagorean comma into these proportions and applying them mathematically calls for the following:

Starting with the F to C interval tuned to a perfect fifth, flatten the fifth by 1/6 of the Pythagorean comma for the first five intervals, keep the next three fifths pure and then flatten the remaining three fifths by 1/18 of the comma.
For electronic instruments, the tuning variance in cents from equal temperament is as follows, based on A440, starting with C:

+6, +4, +2, +5, -2, +8, +2, +4, +5, 0, +6, 0, +6. cents
* Clavier means any keyboard instrument.


Hermann Helmholtz


(1821 - 1894)

Discovered how the brain perceives harmony, proved the existence of combinational tones and warned about the disadvantages of equal temperament.
"Music stands in a much closer connection with pure sensation than any other art," Helmholtz noted in 1862, because "... in music, the sensations of tone are the material of the art." p. 2-3

This extraordinary scientist made important contributions to the fields of medicine, physiology, anatomy and physics, while unifying and relating these sciences to the fine arts.

In his book On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music", first published in 1862, Helmholtz connects the boundaries of physical and physiological acoustics on the one side, and of musical science and esthetics on the other. He argues that it is " the theory of the sensations of hearing to which the theory of music has to look for the foundation of its structure." p.4

 

Physical properties of sound .
Helmholtz begins his analysis of the sensation of hearing by investigating the physical properties of sound. He notes two extremes of sound: noise at one end and musical tones at the other.

He describes a musical tone as "a perfectly undisturbed, uniform sound which remains unaltered as long as it exists" whereas "We perceive that generally a noise is accompanied by a rapid alteration of different kinds of sensations of sound." p.7

A musical tone is made up of its fundamental or prime partial tone.

"In addition to this, the ear also becomes aware of a whole series of higher musical tones which we shall call harmonic upper partial tones, sometimes simply the upper partials of the whole musical tone or note." p 22

Helmholtz points out that, as we can easily compound noises out of musical tones, we should first study the laws and pecularities of this class of sensations because "musical tones are the simpler and more regular elements of the sensation of hearing." p.8

In this section of the work, Helmholtz describes his analyis of the composition of vibrations, musical tones, sympathetic vibration, and the vowel qualities of tone.

 

Physiological properties of sound.
Helmholtz next turns his attention to understanding the part played by the ear in the apprehension of the quality of tone.

He discovered that the cochlea contains thousands of elastic appendages, each of which vibrate sympathetically with different frequencies of sounds as they reach the eardrum.

"The end of every fibre of the auditory nerve is connected with small elastic parts ... set in sympathetic vibration by the waves of sound." p.129

This explains how the brain perceives different frequencies of sound.

Musical science and esthetics.
The third part of his book deals with the construction of musical scales and notes. Some of his more signifigant findings are quoted below:

On scales:

"Here we come at once upon esthetic ground, and the differences of national and individual tastes begin to appear. Modern music has especially developed the principle of tonality, which connects all the tones in a piece of music by their relationship to one chief tone, called the tonic." p. 5
On keys:

"There is nothing in the nature of music itself to determine the pitch of the tonic of any composition...In short, the pitch of the tonic must be chosen so as to bring the compass of the tones of the piece within the compass of the executants, vocal or instrumental. " p. 310
Combinational tones:

His expermients confirm the existance of combinational tones heard whenever two musical tones of different pitches are sounded together.

"The pitch of a combinational tone is generally different from that of either of the generating tones, or of their harmonic upper partials. In experiments, the combinational are readily distinguishable from the upper partial tones, by not being heard when only one generating tone is sounded and by appearing simultaneously with the second tone." p.153

Helmholtz divides them into two classes.

"Differential tones, because their pitch number is the difference of the pitch numbers of the generating tones;" p.153

"Summational tones, having their pitch number equal to the sum of the pitch numbers of the generating tones." p.153
 

On dssonance and consonance:

"When two musical tones are sounded at the same time, their united sound is generally disturbed by the beats of the upper partials, so that a greater or less part of the whole mass of sound is broken up into pulses of tone, and the joint effect is rough. This relation is called Dissonance.

"But there are certain determinate ratios between pitch numbers, for which this rule suffers an exception, and either no beats at all are formed, or at least only such as have so little intensity that they produce no unpleasant disturbance of the united sound. These exceptional cases are called Consonances." p.194

Pythagorean problem solved by Helmholtz:

"The enigma which, about 2,500 years ago, Pythagoras proposed to science, which investigates the reasons of things, 'Why is consonance determined by the ratios of small whole numbers?' has been solved by the discovery that the ear resolves all complex sounds into pendular oscillations, according to the laws of sympathetic vibration, and it regards as harmonious only such excitements of nerves as continue without disturbance." p. 279
 

On equal tempered intonation:
"As regards musical effect, the difference between the just and the equally tempered, or the just and the Pythagorean intonation, is very remarkable.  The justly intoned chords, in favourable positions, not withstanding the rather piercing quality of the tone of the vibrators, possess a full and as it were saturated harmoniousness; they flow on, with a full stream, calm and smooth, without tremor or beat." p.319
"The difference between natural and tempered intonation is greatest and most unpleasant in the higher Octaves of the scale, because here the false combinational tones of the tempered intonation are more observable, and the number of beats for equal differences of pitch becomes larger, and hence the roughness greater." p. 319
"It should be observed that the disturbances due to beats in the tempered scale, are the less observable the swifter the motion, and the shorter the duration of the single notes." p. 322

In 1851, at the Great Exhibition, no English organ was tuned in equal temperament, but the only German organ exhibited (Schultze's) was so tuned.." p.549
 

On forced rapidity:

"Hence in rapid passages, with the soft quality and moderate intensity of tone, the evils of tempered intonation are but little apparent.  Now, almost all instrumental music is designed for rapid movement, and this forms its essential advantage over vocal music.  We might, indeed, raise the question whether instrumental music had not rather been forced into rapidity of movement by this very tempered intonation, which did not allow us to feel the full harmoniousness of slow chords to the same extent as is possible from well-trained singers, and that instruments had consequently been forced to renounce this branch of music." p. 323
 

On music and space:

"Upon this reposes also the characteristic resemblance between the relations of the musical scale and of space, the resemblance which appears to me of vital importance for the peculiar effects of music.  It is an essential character of space that every position within its like bodies can be placed, and like motions can occur.  Everything that is possible to happen in one part of space is equally possible in every part of space and is perceived by us in precisely the same way.  This is also the case with the musical scale.  Every melodic phrase, every chord, which can be executed at any pitch, can also be executed at any other pitch in such a way that we immediately perceive the marks of their similarity." p. 370

 

Don't knock it until you've tried it:

"Musicians have contested, in a very dogmatic manner, the correctness of the propositions here advanced. I do not doubt for a moment that many of these antagonists of mine really perform very good music, because their ear forces them to play better than they intended, better than would really be the case if they actually carried out the regulations of the school and played exactly in Pythagorean or tempered intonation.  On the other hand, it is generally possible to convince oneself from their very writings, that these writers have never taken the trouble to make methodical comparison of just and tempered intonation.  I can only once more invite them to hear, before uttering judgments, founded on an imperfect school-theory, concerning matters which are not within their own personal experience.  Those who have no time for such observations, should at any rate glance over the literature of the period during which equal temperament was introduced.  When the organ took the lead among musical instruments, it was not yet tempered.  And the pianoforte is doubtless a very useful instrument for making the acquaintance of musical literature, or for domestic amusement, or for accompanying singers.  But for artistic purposes its importance is not such as to require its mechanism to be made the basis of the whole system of music." p. 428

 

The difference is really striking:

"It must not be imagined that that the difference between tempered and just intonation is a mere mathematical subtilty without any practical value. That this difference is really striking even to unmusical ears, is shewn immediately by actual experiments with properly tuned instruments." p.320
Final word from Helmholtz:

"And after all, I do not know that it was so neccessary to sacrifice correctness of intonation to the convienience of musical instruments." p. 327
