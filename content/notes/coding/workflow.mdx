# Workflow

## gatsby + MDX + react-powerplug + MDX Preview = ðŸ”¥âš¡

- "MDX: Open Preview"
- quick and runs without gatsby + hot reload (currently set to on save)

## vscode browser preview + debugging = ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- "Browser Preview: Launch" in Debugger
- can use debugger + debug console!
- though not as fast as mdx preview
- can open component by clicking at it (WTF?!?!?)
- sometimes breaks down
- scrolling is really slow

## Problems

gatsby imports fail when placing .mdx file with same name in folder where is also .tsx file

## VSCode Stuff

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v1_43.md#call-hierarchy-support-for-javascript-and-typescript
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakearl.search-editor-apply-changes

## Ideas

- https://thelocalhost.blog/2019/10/31/build-an-mdx-blog/
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-json-schema

### Minimal MDX Rendering / Screenshot Commits

it would be cool to find a good minimal mdx setup. Tools that could be good:

- parcel
- gatsby

this minimal mdx setup could be used with pupeteer to take screenshots / generate pdfs etc...

see parcel/README.md for setup with parcel

### Storybook

See storybook branch...

### typescript to doc / form

Generate JSON schema from ts entry using https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema

`npx typescript-json-schema tsconfig.json Person --include Person.ts`

- json schema could be used to display props in a doc
- can also add comments + TJS types
- could also generate forms for json schemas using: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-yup

### MDX Live Code editor

with "show code" link that shows snippet (similar to storybook)
=> doesnt need the same code twice, once for showing and once for running

#### Anatomy

[post.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/post.js) uses
[MDXRenderer](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/mdx-renderer.js), [@mdx-js/react](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/master/packages/react/src/index.js), which contains
[create-element](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/master/packages/react/src/create-element.js) and
[useMDXComponents](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/master/packages/react/src/context.js).

TODO: find way to use [Live Code Editor](https://mdxjs.com/guides/live-code)
