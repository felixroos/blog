# Workflow

## gatsby + MDX + react-powerplug + MDX Preview = ðŸ”¥âš¡

- "MDX: Open Preview"
- quick and runs without gatsby + hot reload (currently set to on save)

## vscode browser preview + debugging = ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- "Browser Preview: Launch" in Debugger
- can use debugger + debug console!
- though not as fast as mdx preview
- can open component by clicking at it (WTF?!?!?)
- sometimes breaks down
- scrolling is really slow

## Problems

gatsby imports fail when placing .mdx file with same name in folder where is also .tsx file

## VSCode Stuff

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v1_43.md#call-hierarchy-support-for-javascript-and-typescript
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakearl.search-editor-apply-changes

## Ideas

- Could use https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/parcel to build mdx and pupeteer to screenshot current state on commit!
