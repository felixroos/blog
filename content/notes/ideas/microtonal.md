## things i found out playing with tunings

playing with synth one:

## harmonic vs subharmonic tunings

cool new chord relations can be found by switching between harmonic and subharmonic tunings. those chord relations have a really close connection as they are mirrored parts of each other in the harmonic/subharmonic spectrum.

### tetrads

here is an elaborate example of what to do:

- midi transpose 0
- tune to "3 harmonic series: triad"
- press C# D Eb => f major triad
- switch to "3 subharmonic series: triad"
- press same keys => c minor triad 1st inversion

choosing different notes results in different inversions

the same effect can be achieved with "5 Harmonic+Subharmonic Series: Triad" tuning:

- press D E F => f major triad
- press Db Eb F => c minor triad

=> the notes are different now as the mapping changes from 3 to 5 notes

=> 

changing the order of notes changes the inversions

## subscales

when using certain keys (e.g. just white keys) inside a scale + midi transpose, we can navigate a pattern inside the scale!

- use "6 Wilson Hexany (1, 3, 5, 9)"
- press keys C D E F
- midi transpose up and down

+ when holding keys, the pitch stays: this is a good technique for e.g. a drone with changing top notes
